# Hello! 您好！

I am a graduate student at YMSC, Tsinghua working on holography.

## Current Projects

- Trying to understand more about **$T\bar T$ deformation** in the context of $\mathrm{AdS}_ 3$ / $\mathrm{CFT}_ {2\\,}$.
- Looking for a Horowitz-Polchinski type **winding string solution in $\mathrm{AdS}_ {3\\,}$**.
- Understanding entanglement & **modular flow in BMS field theory**.

## Research Interests

I am also interested in studying:
- the black hole information paradox
- higher form symmetries
- holographic tensor networks
- the von Neumann algebra as a formal description of quantum entanglement

I have basic knowledge on these topics but have no prior experience working on them.

## On the Side

I am a GNU/Linux user. I am an "impure" Arch Linux user since I subscribe to the Manjaro repository for stability.
Recently I am enchanted by the pureness of Nix and I actively use Nix as a major package manager.
